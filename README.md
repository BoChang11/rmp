## Introduction
In this project Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree(RRT) and its variant RRT* 
are implemented for holonomic point robot and only RRT for non-holonomic
robot. The non-holonomic robot model considered for this project is also
a point robot but with Reeds-Sheep car's behaviour.

When I was implementing RRT* with non-holonomic constraints, I
noticed that we need to be able to reach a nearby point with its 
orientation from the new configuration. This is mostly impossible to reach
by just trying the six combination of inputs that a Reeds-Shepp Car can
take. So I deviated a little from my original goal of implementing RRT*
for non-holonomic robot to more specific goal of making a robot to move 
from the new configuration to the nearby configuration by doing combinations
of Type 1 and Type 2 maneuvers once it is close enough to the point.
